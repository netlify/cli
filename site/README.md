# Netlify CLI docs site

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

## Architecture

All the command reference pages and the list of commands are automatically generated from the CLI code. This is
automatically inserted into the existing, committed, semi-manually-written pages in `../docs/`. Here's how the flow
works:

1. The `docs.js` script replaces the content between the auto-generation marker comments in the files in `../docs/`; the
   rest you can update manually.
2. The `sync.js` script copies these over to this Astro Starlight site, into `src/content/docs/`. It may also perform
   some minor transformations.
3. From there, it's any old Astro/Starlight docs site, as documented.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on
its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                                                             |
