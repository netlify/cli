  A hex-encoded key that will be used to sign all webhooks sent from this subscription.
  
  You can use the signature to validate that the subscription was sent from OneGraph.
  
  The signature will be sent in the `X-OneGraph-Signature` header of the webhook. The header will contain two parts, a signature and a timestamp (in seconds since the epoch), in the following format:
  
  ```
  X-OneGraph-Signature: t=1582852002,hmac_sha256=7d797ecd431e1a98aaba2f387f2c43241a13c1f093fd9d7e661758963744549a
  ```
  
  To verify the signature:
  1. Extract the timestamp (1582852002 above)
  2. Extract the signature (7d797ecd431e1a98aaba2f387f2c43241a13c1f093fd9d7e661758963744549a above)
  3. Concatenate the timestamp and the request body, separeted by a period (e.g. `t + '.' + requestBody`)
  4. Compute the hmac_sha256 hash of (3)
  5. Compare the hash with the provided signature using a constant-time comparison function (e.g. crypto.timingSafeEqual in Node)
  6. Reject the request if the hash you computed does not match the provided signature or if the timestamp is too far in the past (typically, 5 minutes)
  
  Example for validating the body in Node.js:
  
  ```js
  const SECRET = 'your hmacSha256Key';
  const signature = res.get('X-OneGraph-Signature');
  if (!signature) {
    throw new Error('Missing signature');
  }
  
  const sig = {};
  for (const pair of signature.split(',')) {
    const [k, v] = pair.split('=');
    sig[k] = v;
  }
  
  if (!sig.t || !sig.hmac_sha256) {
    throw new Error('Invalid signature header');
  }
  
  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', SECRET)
    .update(sig.t)
    .update('.')
    .update(res.body)
    .digest('hex');
  
  if (
    !crypto.timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(hash, 'hex'),
      Buffer.from(sig.hmac_sha256, 'hex'),
    )
  ) {
    throw new Error('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  if (parseInt(sig.t, 10) < Date.now() / 1000 - 300 /* 5 minutes */) {
    throw new Error('Request is too old');
  }
  
  // Signature is valid
  ```
  
  Examples for creating the key:
  
  Cli:
  ```cli
  $ openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
  
  Node:
  ```js
  require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
  ```
  
  Ruby:
  ```ruby
  ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(32)'
  ```
