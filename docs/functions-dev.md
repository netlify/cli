title: Developing functions with Netlify CLI
---

# Serving functions locally

With the `netlify dev` command you can simulate the Netlify production environment.
`netlify dev` starts a framework server if it detects one, handles redirects, proxy rules, functions and addons.

However, when developing functions locally, it can be useful to simulate Netlify Functions in a standalone server.
That allows easier debugging and doesn't have the overhead of starting a framework server.

## Usage

- Install the latest `npm install -g netlify-cli`.
- Run `netlify functions:serve` to start the functions server.

Your function will be available at `http://localhost:9999/.netlify/functions/<function-name>`

By default the server serves functions from the configured functions directory, or `netlify/functions` if a functions directory is not configured. The default port for the functions server is `9999`.
To override these settings you can use the `--functions` and `--port` flags:

```sh
netlify functions:serve --functions <path-to-dir> --port <port>
```

or by configuring them via the `netlify.toml` dev block:

```toml
[dev]
functions = "netlify-functions"
functionsPort = 7000
```

## Debugging functions

Netlify CLI uses [Lambda-local](https://github.com/ashiina/lambda-local) to simulate serverless functions.
Since the CLI invokes functions in the same process as the functions server, you can debug functions by inspecting the functions server process.
To do so set the `--inspect` Node.js option when starting the functions server:

- On Windows run `cmd /V /C "set NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect && netlify functions:serve"`
- On Mac/Linux run `NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect netlify functions:serve`

Then attach any Node.js debugger to the CLI process to debug your functions.
