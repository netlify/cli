# Netlify CLI

The Netlify CLI tools lets you create, deploy, and delete new sites straight from your terminal.

This CLI utility is deprecated in favor of [netlifyctl](https://github.com/netlify/netlifyctl) which is the currently maintained CLI utility.

## Installation

To install the CLI tools:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

## Usage

Deploy a front-end project that lives in `my-project` and builds to `dist` directory:

```bash
cd my-project/
netlify deploy dist
```

## Configuration and Authentication

The first time you use the netlify cli command you'll be asked to authenticate.

Your access token is stored in `~/.netlify/config`.

Netlify also stores a local `.netlify` file in the folder where you run `netlify deploy` from where the `site_id` is stored.

## Environments

You can easily setup different environments like `staging` or `production`. Just use the `-e` flag:

```bash
netlify deploy dist -e production
```

Netlify creates different sites with each their own URL for each of your environments and keeps track of them in the `.netlify` config file.

## Caveats

- netlify-cli is known to hang with an "ECONNRESET" error (parsed as JSON, it will look odd) when used from many CI environments.  This is a known issue that is only fixed in our alternate and current CLI:  https://github.com/netlify/netlifyctl

- netlify-cli is known to hang when used with Node.js version 8.1.0.  Version 8.1.2 works well

- the local config file is named `.netlify.local` instead of `.netlify` when you run commands from within your home directory.
